# Introduction

## StreamWave

StreamWave is an aggregate root library designed for streaming environments, aimed at addressing the dual write problem by decoupling the domain model from the event stream. It allows easy integration with .NET Core projects, providing a streamlined approach to managing aggregates and event sourcing. The library offers seamless setup and configuration, ensuring efficient handling of state changes and event applications.
